# Full-Page Product Web Scraper with Pagination | E-Commerce Data Automation

## Overview
I developed a robust, slow-but-sure web scraper using Python, Selenium, and undetected-chromedriver to collect product data from a multi-page e-commerce website. The script navigates through every page automatically, bypasses age verification, scrolls to ensure full content loading, and extracts key product details.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3.11  
- Selenium + undetected-chromedriver  
- BeautifulSoup (optional for parsing)  
- OpenPyXL (for Excel export)  
- Logging & error handling  
- Custom time delays and scrolling  
- VS Code + ChromeDriver  

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ Bypasses age verification screen  
- ✅ Scrolls to load all products dynamically  
- ✅ Clicks through every pagination link until the last page  
- ✅ Scrapes: product name, price, size options, quantity discounts  
- ✅ Saves all data in clean Excel format  
- ✅ Designed for reliability, not just speed  
- ✅ Logs each step clearly in the console  

## 📂 Deliverables
- `scraper.py` (fully documented Python script)  
- `kratom_all_products.xlsx` (final Excel output with full product data)  
- Sample data preview (optional)  
- Setup and run instructions  

## 🔎 Use Case
Perfect for e-commerce professionals, dropshippers, or analysts who need structured product data from websites that use dynamic content and anti-bot protection.
